In this project we used data about weather events in the US to create a crosstab, bar chart, and scatterplot.

Crosstab: The Crosstab uses a KPI of total damage over elapsed time to pinpoint where the most destructive events occurred and what type of event they were. The Adjustable Slider filters out data below a certain level to eliminate outlier or low data.
